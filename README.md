1_Ecol_Mono_SynchronyCalc.R - This file contains the functions to estimate spatial population synchrony. The file is an example of the structure of the calculations and data formatting requirements but will vary based on the data analyzed and the structure of that data.


2_Ecol_Mono_EnvironmentalSynchCalcs.R - This file contains the functions to estimate spatial population synchrony for the environment (temperature and precipitation). 



3_Ecol_Mono_ModelBuilding.R - This file contains code to test models. 



4_Ecol_Mono_CODE_Figures.R - This file contains code necessary to reconstruct Figures 2 - 4 in the main manuscript.
